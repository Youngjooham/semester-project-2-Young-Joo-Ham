# Auksjonen
![Auksjonen Listings](images/auksjonen.jpg)

## Description

#### This website was made for my school Semester Project 2

The brief: An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
